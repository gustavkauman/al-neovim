# AL Neovim
This is an extension for Neovim that allows you to integrate with the
LSP server provided by Microsoft in the [AL
Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al)
VS Code extension.

## Work in progress
Currently this is in its very early stages. Nothing will probably work,
but feel free to contribute if you see easy wins.
